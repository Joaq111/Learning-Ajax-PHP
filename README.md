# PHP + AJAX Learning Project

This repository contains examples and practice projects as I learn how to use PHP with AJAX to build dynamic, interactive web applications without reloading the page.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- PHP
- JavaScript (AJAX)
- HTML/CSS
- MySQL (optional, for backend data handling)

## 📚 What I'm Learning
- How to send and receive data asynchronously using AJAX
- Interacting with PHP scripts in the backend
- Updating web pages dynamically without full page reloads
- Basic database interaction (CRUD) using PHP & AJAX

## 📁 Project Structure
- `/php/` – PHP scripts for backend logic
- `/js/` – JavaScript files with AJAX functions
- `/css/` – Styling for the UI
- `/examples/` – Mini projects and examples

## ✅ Progress
This is a work in progress and will be updated as I continue learning. Feel free to check out the code, give feedback, or suggest improvements!
